1. Entering the loop: when we enter the loop we havenâ€™t compared anything yet. Since we will compare the first element in the array to the ret value of the zeroth element in the array, we will start out i at 1.

This function max takes an array of ints and returns an int

2. end of iteration of loop: at the end of each loop, ret should be set to the value of one of the elements in the array, the max value in the array from items 0-i. 

3. after execution: After execution, ret should be set to the integer in the array with the highest value.
