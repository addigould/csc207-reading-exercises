4.4

relevant inputs: array arr (runtime will depend on number of elements n)


2 operations to count (counting variable assignments):
int ret = arr[0];
ret = arr[i];

Best case: numbers in arr are in descending order
T(n) = 1

Worst case: numbers in arr are in ascending order
T(n) = n+1

Average case: reassignment of ret happens every other element of arr
T(n) = n/2 + 1

4.5

bounds of T(n) = 1:
upper bound: g(n) = 2;
lower bound: f(n) = 0;

bounds of T(n) = n+1:
upper bound: g(n) = n + 2;
lower bound: f(n) = n;

bounds of T(n) = n/2 + 1:
upper bound: g(n) = n/2 + 2;
lower bound: f(n) = n/2;
